Last Updated: 12-09-2023

## Introduction

At Storywise, we are deeply committed to safeguarding the privacy and data protection rights of our users. We fully understand the importance of complying with data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). This data policy outlines our data collection practices, data usage, and the measures we have in place to ensure compliance with these regulations.

## 1. What We Collect and How We Use It

At Storywise, we collect and use data exclusively for the purpose of delivering our services. We do not engage in tracking individuals across devices, websites, or applications, and we do not collect or retain personally identifiable information (PII). The data we collect is aggregated and anonymized. Here is the information we collect and its purpose:

**Page URL:** We track page URLs to provide insights into page views and visitor behavior on your website.

**HTTP Referer:** We use the referrer string to identify the number of visitors referred to your website from external sources.

**User-Agent:** We collect User-Agent data to provide insights into the types of devices and browsers used by visitors to your website.

**Browser:** We collect browser data to present statistics on the types and versions of browsers used by visitors to your website.

**Operating System:** We gather operating system data to show you which operating systems visitors use when accessing your website.

**Device Type:** We categorize devices as desktop, mobile, or tablet to help you understand the devices your website visitors use.

**Country:** We determine visitor locations using IP addresses but do not store IP addresses. We track locations only up to the Country level.

**Language:** We collect language data to provide insights into the languages used by visitors to your website.

## 2. How We Count Visitors

Ensuring the privacy of our users is paramount, and we do not rely on cookies, browser cache, or local storage to generate persistent identifiers. Instead, we utilize the visitor's IP address and User-Agent to create a hash value. This process anonymizes the data, making it impossible to link back to individual users.

```
hash_value(ip_address + user_agent)
```

## 3. Hosting and Data Location

All data collected by Storywise is securely hosted within the European Union (EU). Our servers, are located with Scaleway, a reputable European cloud provider. We adhere to strict data privacy regulations within the EU.

Your data is not shared with advertising companies, and we do not analyze it for personal or behavioral trends. You can exercise control by deleting your account and site statistics at any time, with all data being permanently removed.

## 5. Trust and Open Source
