Last Updated: 12-09-2023

Welcome to Storywise ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our analytics services, including but not limited to our analytics platform and associated services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our Service.

**Note:** The following Terms of Service apply to Storywise Analytics Cloud only and not to Storywise Analytics Self-Hosted which would be hosted on your own servers and therefore the Terms of Service isnâ€™t needed.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using our Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, in which case "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity.

## 2. Changes to Terms

We may revise and update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Terms on our website. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes.


## 3. Use of the Service

**3.1 Access and Accounts:** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Storywise cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

**3.2 Acceptable Use:** You may not use our Service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

**3.3 Data Collection and Privacy:** When you use our Service to measure your website stats, Storywise will collect information about your visitors. You entrust us with your site data, and we take that trust to heart. You agree that Storywise may process your data as described in our [data policy](/data-policy) and for no other purpose.


## 4. Pricing and Payment Terms

Our Service is priced based on the amount of storage you use in gigabytes. You agree to pay for the storage you use according to our pricing structure as specified on our website's [pricing page](/cloud).

You must make payments in advance for the storage you intend to use. We will bill you for your chosen storage amount.

Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable unless agreed otherwise by Storywise.

## 5. Cancellation and Termination

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. If you cancel, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. All your data will be inaccessible from the service after the time you paid for expires.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the service for any reason at any time.

## 6. Modifications to the Service and Prices

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any part of the service with or without notice. We may also change the prices for existing customers with at least 30 days' notice. Such notice may be provided by posting the changes to our website, the service itself, or via email.

## 7. Content Ownership, Copyright, and Trademark

You own all right, title, and interest to your website data. We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the service.

## 8. Privacy and Security of Your Data

We take measures to protect and secure your data. Your data is backed up regularly and stored in a secure manner. You agree that Storywise Analytics may process your data as described in our [data policy](/data-policy) and for no other purpose.

You agree to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection regulations.

## 9. General Conditions

Your use of Storywise is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

Technical support is provided by email.

## 10. Liability


You explicitly acknowledge and agree that Storywise Analytics shall not bear liability, whether in a legal or equitable context, for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages. This includes, but is not limited to, damages related to the loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible assets, even if the company has been made aware of the possibility of such damages. These damages may result from various scenarios, such as: (i) your use of the services or the inability to use them; (ii) costs incurred for acquiring substitute goods and services due to the purchase of goods, data, information, or services, or from messages received or transactions conducted through or as a result of the services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or actions of any third party on the service; or (v) any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the services, regardless of whether it is deemed a breach of contract, a tort (including negligence, whether active or passive), or any other legal theory of liability.


This agreement shall be governed by the laws of Denmark, and any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Denmark.
