      Data, collected automatically when using this Application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is

    </p>

    <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>

    <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
    <p>
      The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized
      access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.
      The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
      tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
      the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data
      may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the
      operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal,
      system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical
      service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
      communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by
      the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the
      Owner at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>

    <p>
      The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
      following applies:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note:
        Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal
        Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without
        having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
        This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data
        is subject to European data protection law;
      </li>
      <li>
        provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with
        the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
      </li>
      <li>
        processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
        the Owner is subject;
      </li>
      <li>
        processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
        interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
      </li>
      <li>
        processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
        pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
      basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
      provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
      requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
    </p>

    <h3>Place</h3>

    <p>
      The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other
      places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring
      the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about
      the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the
      section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers
      to a country outside the European Union or to any international
      organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
      countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the
      Owner to safeguard their Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the
      relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the
      information provided in the contact section.
    </p>

    <h3>Retention time</h3>

    <p>
      Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the
      purpose they have been collected for.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
        contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
        contract has been fully performed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
        interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes.
        Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests
        pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by
        contacting the Owner.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
      whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such
      consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain
      Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the
      performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
      Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
      rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
      expiration of the retention period.
    </p>

    <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>

      its Service, comply with its legal obligations, respond to enforcement
